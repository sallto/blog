# Salto-blog
This is my personal blog I am currently in the process of building. (I also plan on building a marketing style page at /, but this is not ready for now).

## Stack

- Next.js for page-based routing and static-site generation
- Tailwindcss for styling without naming things
- mdx-bundler for mdx based authoring
- preact to reduce initial load bundle size
- framer-motion for animations

## Leasons learned

- Content before styling. By the time I had the site nicely looking, I was a bit burnt-out since I long wanted to write actual content.
- Maybe use a template next time. There are some excellent nextjs based templates, but they are relatively difficult to find.
- Typescript is a lifesaver, but sometimes it is just not possible (remark plugins are basically impossible to write typed)
